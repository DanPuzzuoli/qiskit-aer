class OperatorModel(BaseOperatorModel):
    """OperatorModel representing a sum of :class:`Operator` objects with
    time dependent coefficients.

    Specifically, this object represents a time dependent matrix of
    the form:

    .. math::

        G(t) = \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} s_i(t) G_i,

    for :math:`G_i` matrices (represented by :class:`Operator` objects),
    and the :math:`s_i(t)` given by signals represented by a
    :class:`VectorSignal` object, or a list of :class:`Signal` objects.

    This object contains functionality to evaluate :math:`G(t)` for a given
    :math:`t`, or to compute products :math:`G(t)A` and :math:`AG(t)` for
    :math:`A` an :class:`Operator` or array of suitable dimension.

    Additionally, this class has functionality for representing :math:`G(t)`
    in a rotating frame, and setting frequency cutoffs
    (e.g. for the rotating wave approximation).
    Specifically, given an anti-Hermitian frame operator :math:`F` (i.e.
    :math:`F^\dagger = -F`), entering the frame of :math:`F` results in
    the object representing the rotating operator :math:`e^{-Ft}G(t)e^{Ft} - F`.

    Further, if a frequency cutoff is set, when evaluating the
    `OperatorModel`, any terms with a frequency above the cutoff
    (which combines both signal frequency information and frame frequency
    information) will be set to :math:`0`.

    The signals in the model can be specified either directly (by giving a
    list of Signal objects or a VectorSignal), or by specifying a
    signal_mapping, defined as any function with return type
    `Union[List[Signal], VectorSignal]`. In this mode, assignments to the
    signal attribute will be treated as inputs to the signal_mapping. E.g.

    .. code-block:: python

        signal_map = lambda a: [Signal(lambda t: a * t, 1.)]
        model = OperatorModel(operators=[op], signal_mapping=signal_map)

        # setting signals now will pass the value into the signal_map function
        model.signals = 2.

        # the stored signals (retrivable with model.signals) is now
        # the output of signal_map(2.), converted to a VectorSignal

    See the signals property setter for a more detailed description.
